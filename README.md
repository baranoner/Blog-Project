```sql
CREATE TABLE posts (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER,
    header VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    category VARCHAR(100),
    img_source VARCHAR(255),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```
### 2. Backend Setup

3.  Create a `.env` file in the server root and add your configuration:
    ```env
    
    # Database Config
    DB_PASSWORD=<your_db_password>
    DB_PORT=<your_db_port>
    DB_NAME=<your_db_name>
    
    # Auth Config
    JWT_SECRET=<your_super_secret_random_string>
    ADMIN_PASSWORD=<your_secure_password>
    ADMIN_DB_ID=1
    ```
4.  Start the server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

### 3. Frontend Setup
1.  Navigate to the client folder (open a new terminal):
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
